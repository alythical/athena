# athena

An easy way to upload content to a variety of pastebin services (soonâ„¢), directly from your terminal!

## Usage

Invoke `athena` with one of the supported providers, optionally passing in a path to a file to upload. If you omit a file path,  `athena` will open `$EDITOR` and upload the contents of the saved file to the provider.

```sh
athena <provider> [path/to/file]
```

`athena` will return the url to access the paste.
