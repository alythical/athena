# athena

A small command-line utility to quickly upload code to select providers (see [Providers](#Providers)).

## Usage

Invoke `athena` with one of the supported providers, optionally passing in a path to a file to upload. If you omit a file path,  `athena` will open `$EDITOR` and upload the contents of the saved file to the provider.

```sh
athena <provider> [path/to/file]
```

`athena` will return the url to access the paste.
